This project is under heavy development and is currently just explorative coding (means: nothing at all works yet).

The ProxyFactory implementation for generating the weave objects makes heavy use of doctrines Proxy Factory implementation:
https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/raw/master/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Proxy/ProxyFactory.php

What explorative coding thus far showed:

- there is a need for a Pointcut and Aspect Namespace with the Matchers in it
- there is some code dulication in XmlFileLoader
- there should be a possibility to override the return value in a after or before pointcut via PointcutArguments
- evaluating the matchers at call-time (especially the Advice matchers) could be rather expensive and is very likely the performance bottleneck
- there should be the possibility to weave constructors
- need to write a schema for integrating the aop namespace in the container builders xml format
- should write some tests...


TODO:

also enable callbacks instead of simple service instances
performance/caching????
