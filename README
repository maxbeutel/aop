This project is under heavy development and is currently just explorative coding (means: nothing at all works yet).

The ProxyFactory implementation for generating the weave objects makes heavy use of doctrines Proxy Factory implementation:
https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/raw/master/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Proxy/ProxyFactory.php

What explorative coding thus far showed:

- there should be the possibility to weave constructors
- should write some tests...


TODO:

enable it to have more then one matching aspect per class
aspect should cache which classes it matched in order to perform well when many instances of the same class are instantiated
performance/caching????
